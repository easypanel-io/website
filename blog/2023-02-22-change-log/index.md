Hey there!

It's been a while since we last chatted, but it's not because we've been slacking off! We've been hard at work building some amazing new features that we're excited to share with you.

## Over 120 templates

We're super stoked about how amazing our community has been lately. They've generously contributed and now we've got over 120 templates to choose from. Check them out over here!

## Multi-user support & access control

But that's not all - this week, we're thrilled to announce that we'll be rolling out multi-user support and user access control per project. So whether you're working solo or with a team, you'll have the control you need to get things done.

## Coming up next

And just when you thought things couldn't get any better, we're also launching two-factor authentication next week. It's an extra layer of security that we think will give you some extra peace of mind.

Finally, we wanted to let you know that we're working on database backups, which will be coming your way soon.

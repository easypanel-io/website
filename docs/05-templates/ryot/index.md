## Description

Ryot is a self-hosted platform for tracking and managing your media consumption across movies, TV shows, books, anime, manga, video games, podcasts, and more. Designed as an all-in-one solution for media enthusiasts, Ryot lets you maintain a comprehensive record of everything you&#39;ve watched, read, played, or listened to. The application provides powerful tracking features including progress monitoring, ratings, reviews, and custom lists to organize your media library.

## Description

imgproxy is a powerful app designed to optimize images for web use, making websites and apps run faster while saving storage and SaaS costs. It works by resizing and processing images on the fly, eliminating the need for disk space and reducing the cost of conforming all saved images to specific formats. imgproxy offers a wide range of features for editing images, including resizing, cropping, contrast adjustment, pixelization, saturation, rotating, and more. It also provides security features to protect against common attack vectors in image processing. With imgproxy, you can upload images directly to the cloud or your cluster and request images by specifying parameters in the request URL. The app uses the world’s fastest image processing library, libvips, ensuring quick processing and a small memory footprint. imgproxy Pro plans offer advanced features and vary by capacity and types of support.

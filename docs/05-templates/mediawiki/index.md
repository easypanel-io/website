1-Click installation template for MediaWiki on Easypanel

## Description

MediaWiki is a powerful, open-source wiki platform that powers some of the largest collaborative projects, including Wikipedia. It offers a flexible and extensible framework for creating and managing content, supporting features like user management, version control, and powerful extensions. MediaWiki provides multilingual support, ensuring global accessibility, and includes built-in tools for content organization, search, and collaboration. It is an ideal solution for knowledge bases, documentation sites, and community-driven content platforms. With a vibrant ecosystem of plugins and themes, MediaWiki can be customized to suit diverse use cases.

## Instructions

During the installation, configure the database as prompted, and once completed, a file named &quot;LocalSettings.php&quot; will be downloaded. Open EasyPanel, navigate to the Storage section for MediaWiki, and create a file mount.

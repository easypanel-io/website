# Nametag

1-Click installation template for Nametag on Easypanel

## Description

Nametag is a simple, yet effective Personal Relationship Manager (PRM) - like a CRM, but for your actual relationships instead of sales prospects. Built with Next.js, it helps you manage your personal network by tracking contacts, mapping relationships between people, and visualizing your network with interactive graphs. Remember when you last talked to an old friend, their kids&#39; names, or their birthday. Organize contacts into custom groups, set reminders for important dates and staying in touch, and keep all your relationship data in one secure, self-hosted location.

## Benefits

- Personal Relationship Management: Keep track of all your personal relationships in one place - friends, family, colleagues, and more. Never forget important details about the people you care about.
- Network Visualization: Visualize your entire personal network with interactive graphs powered by D3.js, making it easy to see relationships and connections at a glance.
- Stay Connected: Set reminders for important dates, birthdays, and when to reach out to people, helping you maintain meaningful relationships over time.
- Self-Hosted Privacy: Complete control over your relationship data with no reliance on external cloud services. All your personal information stays on your server.
- Unlimited Contacts: Self-hosted instances have no account limits - store unlimited contacts and relationships without restrictions.

## Features

- Contact Management: Track people with flexible attributes including names, birthdays, important dates, and custom notes for everything else.
- Relationship Mapping: Define and visualize relationships between people - family, friends, colleagues, and custom relationship types.
- Interactive Network Graphs: Visualize your entire personal network with interactive D3.js-powered graphs showing connections and relationships.
- Custom Groups: Organize contacts into custom groups for better organization and management of your personal network.
- Automated Reminders: Scheduled cron jobs send automated reminders for important dates and staying in touch, running daily at 8 AM UTC.
- Multi-Language Support: Available in multiple languages including English and Spanish, with mobile-responsive design for access from any device.
- Dark Mode: Full dark mode support for comfortable viewing in any lighting condition.

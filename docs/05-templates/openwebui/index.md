1-Click installation template for OpenWebUI on Easypanel

## Description

OpenWebUI is a self-hosted, open-source web-based UI for interacting with various Large Language Models (LLMs). It allows users to chat with AI models, manage API connections, and customize their experience through an intuitive interface. OpenWebUI supports multiple backends such as Ollama, OpenAI-compatible APIs, and local AI runners. It offers a sleek web-based UI, user authentication, and integration with popular LLMs. The application is containerized and easy to deploy with Docker, Kubernetes, or standalone installations. It provides real-time chat, conversation history, and advanced configuration options for AI interactions.

## Benefits

- AI Model Interaction: OpenWebUI provides a user-friendly interface to interact with AI models. Users can chat with various LLMs, customize their prompts, and manage API configurations effortlessly.
- Multi-Backend Support: OpenWebUI supports multiple AI backends, including Ollama, OpenAI-compatible APIs, and local AI model hosting. This flexibility allows users to choose their preferred AI provider and optimize cost and performance.
- Self-Hosted & Privacy-Focused: OpenWebUI is self-hosted, ensuring full control over AI interactions and data privacy. Users can deploy it on their own servers or cloud infrastructure without relying on third-party services.

## Features

- Chat Interface: A sleek and responsive chat interface allows users to interact with AI models in real-time. The UI supports markdown, code formatting, and rich text responses.

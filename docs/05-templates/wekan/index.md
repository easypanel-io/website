## Description

WeKan is an open-source, customizable, and privacy-focused Kanban app designed for efficient task management. It allows you to create multiple boards for different projects or tasks, with each board having columns to represent different stages of your work such as &#39;To Do&#39;, &#39;Doing&#39;, and &#39;Done&#39;. You can add cards to each board to represent tasks, complete with titles, descriptions, and due dates. WeKan uses lists on a Kanban board to represent different stages of a workflow, helping you organize and track tasks. You can customize lists by changing their color or adding custom fields to capture more information about tasks. A card in WeKan represents a task on a Kanban board, including a title, description, due date, labels, and comments. As work progresses, you can move the card from one column to another. WeKan also offers several features to protect your data, including a self-hosting option, access controls, and open-source code for security auditing. It is designed with security in mind, and its features and options are built to help you protect your data and keep it secure.

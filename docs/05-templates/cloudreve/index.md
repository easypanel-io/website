## Description

Cloudreve is a self-hosted cloud storage platform that allows you to build your own file hosting and sharing service with support for multiple storage backends. Designed as a powerful alternative to commercial cloud storage services, Cloudreve provides a feature-rich web interface for uploading, organizing, and sharing files with complete control over your data. The application supports various storage providers including local storage, remote servers, OneDrive, S3-compatible storage, and more, allowing you to leverage existing infrastructure or cloud services as backends. Key features include drag-and-drop uploads, file previews for images, videos, and documents, shareable download links with optional password protection and expiration dates, and WebDAV support for seamless integration with desktop and mobile applications. Cloudreve offers user management with customizable storage quotas, group permissions, and file policies to control how users interact with the system. The modern, responsive interface works across devices, providing a smooth experience whether accessing from desktop or mobile. Built with performance in mind, Cloudreve uses PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and Redis for caching, ensuring fast and responsive file operations.

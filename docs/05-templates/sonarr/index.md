## Description

Sonarr is a Personal Video Recorder (PVR) designed for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It monitors multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and automatically grabs, sorts, and renames them. Sonarr can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available. It features a calendar to see all your upcoming episodes in one convenient location, and a manual search to find all the releases and choose the one you want. Sonarr also handles failed downloads, automatically blocking the release and trying another one until it finds one that works. It is fully integrated with SABnzbd, NZBGet, Kodi, and Plex, and supports major platforms including Windows, Linux, macOS, and Raspberry Pi.

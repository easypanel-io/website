# CubeJS

1-Click installation template for CubeJS on Easypanel

## Description

Cube is a Semantic Layer for every data app that aims to connect data silos, drive consistent metrics, and power your AI and analytics with context. It allows you to define and manage metrics upstream to consolidate your workflow, centralize definitions, and create a single source of truth. The app also provides granular access controls to grant column- and role-based operational and viewing permissions upstream. Cube ensures your data is reliably performant with a powerful caching layer and advanced preaggregation capabilities. Furthermore, it allows you to connect your data to any front-end application to build beautiful custom visualizations with Cube’s GraphQL, REST, and SQL APIs. Cube is an API-first, four-part semantic layer that enables data engineers and developers to make their data consistent, secure, performant, and accessible across every application.

## Benefits

- Unified Data Management: The app serves as a semantic layer for every data application, connecting data silos and driving consistent metrics. It powers your AI and analytics with context, creating a single source of truth for your data.
- Enhanced Data Security: The app provides granular access controls, granting column- and role-based operational and viewing permissions. It ensures that only the right people have access to the right metrics.
- Optimized Performance: With a powerful caching layer and advanced pre-aggregation capabilities, the app ensures your data is reliably performant. It keeps every downstream app updated with the latest information cost-effectively and with low latency.
- Universal Compatibility: The app allows you to connect your data to any front-end application. With Cube’s GraphQL, REST, and SQL APIs, it provides the universal compatibility data engineers and developers need.

## Features

- Data Modeling: Define and manage metrics upstream to consolidate your workflow, centralize definitions, and create a single source of truth. The app uses Data Models to model raw data into meaningful business definitions and pre-aggregate data for optimal results.
- Access Control: Grant column- and role-based operational and viewing permissions upstream with granular access controls. In the app, authorization is based on the security context, and authentication tokens are generated based on your API secret.
- Caching: Ensure your data is reliably performant with a powerful caching layer and advanced pre-aggregation capabilities. The app provides a two-level caching system: in-memory cache and configurable pre-aggregations.
- APIs: Connect your data to any front-end application to build beautiful custom visualizations. The app’s SQL, REST, and GraphQL APIs provide the universal compatibility data engineers and developers need.

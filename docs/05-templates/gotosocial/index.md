1-Click installation template for GoToSocial on Easypanel

## Description

GoToSocial is a lightweight, customizable, and safety-focused social network server that provides a fun and fast entryway into the Fediverse. It is written in Golang and allows you to keep in touch with friends, post, read, and share images and articles without being tracked or advertised to. If you&#39;ve used platforms like Twitter or Tumblr, GoToSocial will feel familiar. You can follow people, have followers, make posts that others can favorite, reply to, and share, and scroll through posts from people you follow using a timeline. You can write long or short posts, post images, and even block people or limit unwanted interactions by posting just to your friends. GoToSocial is not designed for influencers with tens of thousands of followers, nor is it designed to be addictive. Your timeline and experience are shaped by who you follow and how you interact with people, not by engagement metrics. GoToSocial is ideal for small or single-user instances running on low-powered devices, like single-board computers or old laptops repurposed as home servers. It is simple to install and maintain, and prioritizes good security and sensible defaults.

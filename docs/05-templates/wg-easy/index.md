1-Click installation template for Wg-easy on Easypanel

## Description

WireGuard Easy is an all-in-one application designed to simplify the installation and management of WireGuard on any Linux host. With a user-friendly web interface, it allows you to list, create, edit, delete, enable, and disable clients with ease. You can also view a client&#39;s QR code and download a client&#39;s configuration file directly from the app. The app provides statistics on which clients are connected and features Tx/Rx charts for each connected client. It also supports Gravatar. WireGuard Easy requires a host with a kernel that supports WireGuard and Docker installed.

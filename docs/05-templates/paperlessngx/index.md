## Description

Paperless-ngx is a modern document management system designed to convert your physical documents into a searchable online archive, helping you maintain a clutter-free, paperless environment. It uses advanced OCR technology to add selectable text to image-only documents, and allows you to organize and index your scanned documents with tags, correspondents, types, and more. The app supports a variety of file formats including PDFs, images, plain text files, and Office documents. It also features a single-page application front end with a dashboard that displays basic statistics and allows document upload. With its full-text search functionality, you can easily find the documents you need, with results sorted by relevance to your search query. The app also includes email processing, enabling it to add documents from your email accounts. Moreover, Paperless-ngx is powered by machine learning, enabling it to learn from your documents and automatically assign tags, correspondents, and types to documents once you&#39;ve stored a few documents in it. It is optimized for multi-core systems, allowing it to process multiple documents in parallel.

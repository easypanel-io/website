## Description

Bazarr is a companion application to Sonarr and Radarr, designed to manage and download subtitles based on your specific needs. It allows you to define your preferences by TV show or movie, and Bazarr handles the rest. The app automatically searches for missing subtitles and downloads them as soon as they become available in your desired language. It also offers a manual search feature to find all matching subtitles, allowing you to choose the one you want and download it to your media directory. Bazarr also regularly searches for matching subtitles and upgrades the ones you previously downloaded if a better one is found. Please note that Bazarr does not scan the disk to detect series and movies, it only manages the series and movies that are indexed in Sonarr and Radarr.

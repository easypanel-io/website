1-Click installation template for Shaarli on Easypanel

## Description

Shaarli is a personal, minimalist, super-fast, and database-free bookmarking service. It allows you to manage and share the links you discover, making it an ideal tool for those who frequently come across interesting content on the web. With Shaarli, you can share, comment, and save links, use it as a minimal blog or writing platform, or even as a read-it-later/todo list. It also serves as a notepad for drafting and saving articles, posts, or ideas, and a knowledge base for keeping notes, documentation, and code snippets. You can edit, view, and search your links, organize them with tags, and even generate ATOM and RSS feeds. Shaarli is self-hosted, meaning you install it on your own server, ensuring your data remains yours. It&#39;s an excellent alternative to commercial services, and it&#39;s free and open-source.

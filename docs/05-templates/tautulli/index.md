## Description

Tautulli is a powerful web application designed to monitor, analyze, and notify you about your Plex Media Server&#39;s activities. It runs alongside your Plex Media Server, tracking a variety of statistics including what has been watched, who watched it, when and where it was watched, and how it was watched. The app presents all these statistics in a clean, user-friendly interface with tables and graphs. Tautulli also allows you to monitor current activity on your Plex Media Server, log watch history for all your users, view streaming trends with intuitive graphs, trigger notifications or scripts from events on your Plex server, and keep track of when content is added to your Plex library. You can also create and send newsletters for recently added media, view and delete all synced content from your server, see detailed information on all of your media, and even download the official app to view activity and stats on the go. Tautulli is compatible with any system that supports python.

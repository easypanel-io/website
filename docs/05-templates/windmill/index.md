It is designed to help you create internal apps and robust workflows using code only where necessary. With Windmill Cloud, you can make your scripts production-grade and build all your internal tools using Python, Typescript, Go, Bash, Sql. You can compose your scripts as workflows using low-code and share an autogenerated UI or build one using low-code. The app is designed to run reliably at scale on your infrastructure or ours, with permissioning and monitoring included. It is a fully open-source alternative to Airplane, Superblocks &amp; Retool, and it&#39;s easy to deploy on both small and large infrastructures. With Windmill Cloud, you can run long-running heavy background jobs, script with complex dependencies, endpoints with high rpm or simple one-off tasks without any overhead. You can trigger them from a webhook or the auto-generated UI and monitor them easily. Additionally, Windmill Cloud allows you to build complex flows without complexity, from atomic scripts, either from your workspace or the Hub.

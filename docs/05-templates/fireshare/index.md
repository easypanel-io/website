1-Click installation template for Fireshare on Easypanel

## Description

Fireshare is a simple, user-friendly app designed to make sharing your game clips, videos, or other media a breeze. With Fireshare, you no longer have to go through the hassle of uploading your short clips to YouTube and waiting for them to process. Instead, you can easily self-host your clips and share them with your friends through unique links generated by the app. All you need to do is put your videos in a folder and Fireshare will handle the rest. The app also allows you to view all your videos, edit their details, and decide whether you want them to show up on the public feed. Fireshare also supports foldered sorting, allowing you to organize your videos into categories of your choosing. The app is mobile-friendly and supports open graph data, allowing websites and messaging apps to display the title, description, and video thumbnails in your posts.

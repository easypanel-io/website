1-Click installation template for Ampache on Easypanel

## Description

Ampache is a web-based audio/video streaming application and file manager that allows you to access your music and videos from anywhere, anytime. With this app, you can browse and manage your music collection through a simple web interface, and even synchronize local and remote catalogs to create a unique, consistent collection. Ampache also offers music streaming capabilities, allowing you to stream your music to your preferred player, control it with Localplay, or directly listen on the web page with the HTML5 player. The app is completely free and open source, and it&#39;s designed to work on almost any internet-enabled device, including your phone, tablet, or television. Ampache is not a media organizer, but a tool that presents an already organized collection in a useful way.

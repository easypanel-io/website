It&#39;s not just limited to online use - you can also use it as a desktop code editor, provided you have PHP 7.0+. It comes packed with a multitude of features and plugins to enhance your coding experience, including multiple cursors, 80+ highlighting themes, a find &amp; replace builder, login security, coding assistance, visual code difference display, and database management with the Adminer plugin.

- Accessible Anywhere: As Illa Cloud is web-based, you can use it from any internet-enabled computer with a modern browser.

## Features

- Multiple Cursors: Create multiple cursors and make text changes to affect all of them simultaneously.

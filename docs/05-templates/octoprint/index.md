1-Click installation template for OctoPrint on Easypanel

## Description

OctoPrint is a comprehensive web interface designed to provide full remote control and monitoring of your 3D printer. It allows you to manage every aspect of your 3D printing jobs directly from your browser. With OctoPrint, you can access the embedded webcam feed to watch your printer in action, receive constant feedback on the progress of your print job, and even view a rendition of the GCODE you are currently printing. The app also enables you to monitor and adjust the temperatures of your hotends and print bed on the fly, move the print head along all axes, and start, stop, or pause your print job at any time. OctoPrint is compatible with most consumer 3D printers and its powerful plugin system allows for functionality extension. It is 100% open source, allowing everyone to modify it to their own needs. Additional features include creating timelapse recordings of your prints, slicing your STL files directly within the app, built-in access controls, and the ability to add system commands to the menu for easy shutdown or reboot of your OctoPrint server or printer.

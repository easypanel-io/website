1-Click installation template for Heimdall on Easypanel

## Description

Heimdall Application Dashboard is a versatile and visually pleasing dashboard for all your web applications. It provides a simple and elegant interface where you can add links to any web application or site you frequently use. The app is designed with simplicity in mind, avoiding the trap of over-complication that many projects fall into. With Heimdall, you can add a link to anything, whether it&#39;s intrinsically supported or not, by simply filling in the name, background color, and the link URL. The app also supports Foundation and Enhanced apps. Foundation apps are those supported by Heimdall, and Enhanced apps are like Foundation apps but with the added feature of displaying extra information automatically by entering API credentials. Heimdall is all about making your web application experience smooth, simple, and enjoyable.

## Benefits

- Simplicity: Heimdall Application Dashboard is designed to avoid the trap of over-complication. It offers a straightforward interface that users can fine-tune to match their needs without getting overwhelmed by a multitude of options.
- Elegance: The design of Heimdall Application Dashboard is visually pleasing, encouraging users to explore and utilize its features. The goal is to make users want to use the app, not just need to use it.

## Features

- Versatile Dashboard: Heimdall Application Dashboard serves as a comprehensive dashboard for all your web applications. It's not limited to applications; you can add links to anything you like, making it a versatile tool for managing your digital resources.
- Generic, Foundation, and Enhanced Apps: Heimdall supports three types of items: Generic, Foundation, and Enhanced apps. Generic items allow you to add a link to anything, while Foundation and Enhanced apps offer more features, such as default icons and background colors, and the ability to display extra information through an app's API.

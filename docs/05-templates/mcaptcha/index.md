1-Click installation template for mCaptcha on Easypanel

## Description

mCaptcha is a proof-of-work based captcha system that prioritizes user privacy and offers a fully automated experience. Unlike traditional captcha systems, mCaptcha does not track or profile users, ensuring a privacy-focused user experience. It is designed to be robust and accurate, not relying on IP addresses for rate-limiting, making it suitable for users behind NATs. The user experience is silent and seamless, eliminating the need for annoying image-based captchas. mCaptcha uses a proof-of-work solution to fiercely defend your site, making it more expensive for attackers to target your site than for you to respond to their requests. It is a libre software, with client libraries licensed under proprietary-friendly free software licenses. mCaptcha is also compatible with reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha, making it a convenient drop-in replacement. The core functionality of mCaptcha is to use a SHA256 based proof-of-work system to rate limit users, providing a token upon successful validation that users can then submit with their request or form submission to the target website.

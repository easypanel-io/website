# FOSSFlow

1-Click installation template for FOSSFlow on Easypanel

## Description

FOSSFlow is an open-source diagramming and flowchart application that enables users to create, edit, and manage technical diagrams, flowcharts, and process visualizations. Built for developers, system architects, and technical teams, FOSSFlow provides an intuitive interface for designing workflows, system architectures, database schemas, and network diagrams. The application supports server-side storage for persistent diagram saving and optional Git backup integration for version control and collaboration. With a lightweight Node.js backend and modern frontend, FOSSFlow offers a self-hosted alternative to cloud-based diagramming tools, giving you complete control over your technical documentation and diagrams. Perfect for teams that need to document systems, design workflows, create technical specifications, and maintain architectural diagrams without relying on external services or sharing sensitive information with third parties.

## Benefits

- Self-Hosted Diagramming: Keep your technical diagrams and workflows private on your own infrastructure without relying on cloud services.
- Version Control Integration: Optional Git backup support enables version history tracking and team collaboration on diagram changes.
- Persistent Storage: Server-side storage ensures your diagrams are saved securely and accessible across sessions and devices.

## Features

- Technical Diagramming: Create flowcharts, system architectures, database schemas, network diagrams, and process visualizations with an intuitive interface.
- Server-Side Storage: Configurable server storage saves diagrams persistently with organized file management in dedicated storage volumes.
- Git Backup Support: Enable Git integration to automatically backup diagrams, track changes, and collaborate with team members through version control.
- Production Ready: Optimized for production deployment with Node.js backend and efficient resource utilization for reliable performance.
- Open Source: Free and open-source software gives you complete transparency, customization options, and no vendor lock-in.

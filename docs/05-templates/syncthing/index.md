1-Click installation template for Syncthing on Easypanel

## Description

Syncthing is a powerful, real-time file synchronization program designed to keep your data secure and under your control. It enables the synchronization of files between two or more computers, ensuring your data is always up-to-date across your devices. Syncthing prioritizes your privacy and security, with no data ever stored on a central server that could be compromised. All communication is encrypted and authenticated, with only devices you have explicitly allowed able to connect to your other devices. The app is easy to use, with a responsive and powerful interface accessible via your browser. It works across various operating systems including Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, OpenBSD, and many others. Syncthing doesn&#39;t require complex configuration or IP addresses, it simply works, over LAN and over the Internet. You can synchronize as many folders as you need with different people or just between your own devices.

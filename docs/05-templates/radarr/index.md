## Description

Radarr is a movie collection manager designed for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It monitors multiple RSS feeds for new movies and interfaces with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. Radarr also has the ability to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in your library when a better quality format becomes available. The app features a calendar to see all your upcoming movies in one place, manual search to find all the releases and choose the one you want, and automatic handling of failed downloads. Radarr ensures you get the right release every time with its custom formats feature, which allows fine control over release prioritization and selection. It also supports major platforms like Windows, Linux, macOS, and others.

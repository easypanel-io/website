## Description

Password Pusher is an open-source, self-hosted application designed to securely share passwords and sensitive information via unique, time-sensitive URLs. It eliminates the need to send sensitive credentials through insecure channels like email or messaging apps. The app is lightweight, easy to deploy, and prioritizes user privacy and security. Password Pusher allows for fine-grained control over link expiration, including the number of views or days before a link expires. It ensures that shared passwords are destroyed after expiration, adding an extra layer of security. The app can be deployed on various platforms such as Docker or Kubernetes, making it highly flexible and accessible for individuals and organizations alike.

## Description

LibreTranslate is a free and open-source machine translation app that is entirely self-hosted. Unlike other translation apps, it does not rely on proprietary providers such as Google or Azure to perform translations. Instead, its translation engine is powered by the open-source Argos Translate library. LibreTranslate can translate text between different languages, auto-detect the language of the input text, and even handle HTML content. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input the text they want to translate, select the source and target languages, and get the translated text. With LibreTranslate, you can enjoy a reliable, accurate, and privacy-friendly translation service right at your fingertips.

## Benefits

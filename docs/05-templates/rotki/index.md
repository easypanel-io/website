## Description

Rotki is a comprehensive asset management and accounting application, specifically designed for crypto assets. The app is designed to help with tax reporting by importing, displaying, storing, and generating reports and statistics from cryptocurrency transaction data and other assets. It integrates with multiple exchanges, providing a centralized platform for managing your crypto assets. Rotki also offers the ability to generate profit/loss reports, making it easier to understand your financial standing. It&#39;s important to note that while Rotki aids in tax reporting, it does not provide tax or legal advice, and it&#39;s the user&#39;s responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the data provided to the service. The app is not intended for continuous monitoring of transaction data or for automatic transmission of your transaction data to any tax authority.

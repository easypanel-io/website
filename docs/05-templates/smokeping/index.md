## Description

SmokePing is a powerful open-source tool designed for network monitoring and latency measurement. It provides real-time visualizations of network latency and packet loss, making it easier to identify and diagnose connectivity issues. SmokePing uses ICMP and other protocols to monitor latency across multiple targets and generates detailed graphs to highlight network performance over time. It supports alerting, letting you know when latency or packet loss exceeds predefined thresholds. With its flexible configuration and plugin system, SmokePing can be adapted to various network environments, providing valuable insights into network health and reliability.

## Instructions

You may configure your targets by taking the console from Easypanel

1-Click installation template for Photoview on Easypanel

## Description

Photoview is a user-friendly photo gallery designed for photographers. It allows you to easily navigate through directories filled with high-resolution photos and videos. The app syncs with your file system, automatically organizing your media based on the file structure. Directories become albums filled with the photos and videos found within them. Photoview also automatically rescans for new media, keeping your gallery updated. Multiple users can be configured, each with their own directory of photos and videos, and each user&#39;s media is kept private with a username and password. Albums and individual photos or videos can be shared through public or password-protected links. Photoview also analyzes photos for EXIF metadata, displaying this information next to the photo and using it to present photos on a map. The app also has a mobile version for iOS, allowing you to quickly access your media library from your phone. Photoview supports RAW images, automatically extracts metadata from images and videos, and optimizes videos for the web. It also generates thumbnails automatically and ensures that your media is secure and private.

## Instructions

You will need to mount the location where your photos are to complete the installation.

## Benefits

- Easy Media Organization: Photoview allows you to easily organize your media files. It automatically scans your file system for media and organizes them based on the file structure. Directories become albums populated with the photos and videos found inside.
- User Privacy: Photoview ensures user privacy by allowing each user to have their own directory of photos and videos. Each user is configured with a username and password, keeping their media private.
- Quick Access: With the official iOS app, you can quickly access your entire media library from your phone. Navigate, share, and download photos and videos directly within the app.
- Secure and Private: Photoview ensures the security of your media resources with a cookie-token, properly hashed passwords, and a strict CORS policy. Your media is valuable, and with Photoview, nothing leaves your server.

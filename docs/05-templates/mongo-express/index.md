1-Click installation template for Mongo Express on Easypanel

## Description

mongo-express is a web-based MongoDB admin interface designed with Node.js, Express, and Bootstrap3. It allows you to connect to multiple databases, view, add, delete databases, and manage collections. You can also view, add, update, and delete documents within these collections. The app supports previewing audio, video, and image assets inline in the collection view. Large or nested objects are collapsible for easy overview, and big document properties are loaded on-demand to keep the collection view fast. The app also supports GridFS, enabling you to add, get, and delete incredibly large files. It uses BSON data types in documents and is mobile responsive, thanks to Bootstrap 3. The app also supports connection and authentication to individual databases, as well as admin authentication to view all databases. It includes features for database blacklist/whitelist, custom CA, and CA validation disabling, and supports replica sets.

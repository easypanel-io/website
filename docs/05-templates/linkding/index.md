1-Click installation template for linkding on Easypanel

## Description

Linkding is a self-hosted bookmark manager that allows you to efficiently manage and organize your bookmarks. With a clean and optimized user interface, you can easily add, share, and edit bookmarks. The app also allows you to add notes to your bookmarks using Markdown and provides a &#39;read it later&#39; functionality. It automatically generates titles, descriptions, and icons for your bookmarked websites and creates snapshots of them on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. You can also import and export bookmarks in Netscape HTML format. The app offers light and dark themes for your convenience. It also provides a REST API for developing third-party apps and an admin panel for user self-service and raw data access.

## Instructions

If the login fails with a error 500, please restart the &quot;linkding&quot; app service. This can be caused by the database not being properly reachable at linkding&#39;s first start.

1-Click installation template for Tolgee on Easypanel

## Description

Tolgee is a revolutionary localization platform designed to simplify and speed up the translation process of your application. With Tolgee, you can translate your app into any language without modifying your code. It offers a range of features including in-context translating, translation memory, machine translations, auto translation, and activity log. The in-context translating feature allows you to translate strings directly in the app you develop, even in production. Translation memory ensures you don&#39;t translate the same string twice by reusing strings you&#39;ve already translated. Machine translations let you leverage the power of DeepL, Google Translate, and AWS translate. Auto translation delivers your translations instantly right after you add them. The activity log feature helps you monitor the translation activities. Tolgee also allows users to add screenshots with a single click, providing context for translations. It is designed to be developer-friendly with easy integration with all major JS frameworks. Tolgee is not only easy to use for developers but also for translators, making the localization process seamless and efficient.

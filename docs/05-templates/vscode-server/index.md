# Visual Studio Code Server

1-Click installation template for Visual Studio Code Server on Easypanel

## Description

The LinuxServer.io team presents the docker-code-server, a powerful tool that allows you to run VS Code on a remote server, accessible through your browser. This means you can code on your Chromebook, tablet, and laptop with a consistent development environment. If you&#39;re using a Windows or Mac workstation, you can more easily develop for Linux. The app also allows you to leverage large cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more. It helps preserve battery life when you&#39;re on the go, as all intensive computation runs on your server, eliminating the need for running excess instances of Chrome.

## Benefits

- Access VS Code from anywhere: Code-server allows you to access Visual Studio Code from any device with a browser. Whether you're using a Chromebook, tablet, or laptop, you can have a consistent development environment.
- Develop for Linux on Windows or Mac: With code-server, you can easily develop applications for Linux even if you're using a Windows or Mac workstation. Take advantage of large cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more.
- Preserve battery life: By running intensive computations on your server instead of your local device, code-server helps preserve battery life when you're on the go. You no longer need to run excess instances of Chrome.

## Features

- Remote development: Access Visual Studio Code remotely from any device with a browser.
- Cross-platform development: Develop applications for Linux on Windows or Mac workstations.
- Server-side computation: Offload intensive computations to your server to preserve battery life.

## Description

Cal.com is a versatile scheduling app designed to streamline the process of setting up meetings, appointments, and events. It allows users to set their availability, connect their existing calendars, and share a personal link for others to book a meeting at a time that works for both parties. The app ensures you never get double booked by checking for conflicts across all your calendars. It also offers workflow automation, enabling you to build processes around your events with automatic notifications, reminders, and follow-ups. With features like round-robin scheduling, routing forms, and meeting overload prevention, Cal.com adapts to any business, making it an ideal solution for doctors, companies, teachers, and experts. The app is available in over 26 languages and can be embedded anywhere for easy access. It also offers simple rescheduling and requires confirmation to ensure smooth scheduling.

## Benefits

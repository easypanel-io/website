## Description

Redlib is a privacy-focused and lightweight alternative frontend for Reddit, designed to enhance user experience by removing ads, tracking, and unnecessary JavaScript. Built using Rust, Redlib delivers a fast and efficient browsing experience while ensuring user privacy by proxying all requests, including media, through its server. It provides an ad-free, clutter-free interface inspired by Reddit&#39;s modern design, making it an ideal choice for users seeking a secure and streamlined way to browse Reddit content.

## Benefits

## Features

- No Ads or Tracking: Browse Reddit without interruptions or intrusive tracking, enjoying a clean and distraction-free interface.
- Proxy-Based Privacy: All requests, including media, are proxied through Redlib’s server to ensure user anonymity and secure content delivery.

# Blinko

1-Click installation template for Blinko on Easypanel

## Description

Blinko (space) is an open-source, self-hosted “idea hub” that rolls notes, micro-blog posts, paste-bins and lightweight tasks into one minimalist, card-style interface. You jot down thoughts in plain text or Markdown; behind the scenes Blinko indexes every word with an AI-powered RAG engine (works with OpenAI or a local Ollama model), so you can later retrieve anything with natural-language search instead of keywords

# Langflow

1-Click installation template for Langflow on Easypanel

## Description

Langflow is an innovative application designed to facilitate the experimentation and prototyping of LangChain pipelines. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating flows by simply dragging and connecting LangChain components such as LLMs, prompt serializers, agents, and chains. You can easily modify prompt parameters, link chains and agents, track an agent&#39;s thought process, and export your flow. Once your flow is ready, you can export it as a JSON file for use with LangChain. Langflow also integrates with langchain-serve for one-command deployment to Jina AI Cloud. With Langflow, building and deploying LangChain pipelines has never been easier.
